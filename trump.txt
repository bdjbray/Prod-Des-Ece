0  I AM DRAINING THE SWAMP!                                                                                            
1  If that perfect phone call with the President of Ukraine Isn¡¯t considered appropriate, then no future President can  EVER again speak to another foreign leader!
2  Sounding more and more like the so-called Whistleblower isn¡¯t a Whistleblower at all. In addition, all second hand  information that proved to be so inaccurate that there may not have even been somebody else, a leaker or spy, feeding it to him or her? A partisan operative?
3  The Democrats are now to be known as the DO NOTHING PARTY!                                                                                  
4  Rep. Adam Schiff totally made up my conversation with Ukraine President and read it to Congress and Millions. He must resign and be investigated. He has been doing this for two years. He is a sick man!
5  ¡°IT WAS A PERFECT CONVERSATION WITH UKRAINE PRESIDENT!¡±                                                                                     
6  Iran wanted me to lift the sanctions imposed on them in order to meet. I said, of course, NO!

8  ...sound horrible, and me sound guilty. HE WAS DESPERATE AND HE GOT CAUGHT. Adam Schiff therefore lied to Congress  and attempted to defraud the American Public. He has been doing this for two years. I am calling for him to immediately resign from Congress based on this fraud!
9  Rep. Adam Schiff fraudulently read to Congress, with millions of people watching, a version of my conversation with the President of Ukraine that doesn¡¯t exist. He was supposedly reading the exact transcribed version of the call, but he completely changed the words to make it...
